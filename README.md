<h1>Project Overview</h1>
This project utilizes GeoFlink, the spatial extension of the real-time distributed processing engine Apache Flink, for processing streaming data. We focus on aggregating trajectories sent from robot edges to monitor and analyze their movements effectively.

<h1>Key Features</h1>

<h3>Queries Implemented</h3>
1- Maximum Average Speed of All Robots: This query calculates the maximum average speed attained by any robot in the system, helping in monitoring speed regulations and identifying outliers.
<br>
2- Collision Detection: Detects potential collisions between robots by analyzing their trajectories in real-time. This feature is crucial for preventing accidents and ensuring the safety of robotic operations.

<h3>Alerts and Warnings</h3>
Anomaly Detection: The system automatically generates alerts and warnings when anomalies such as potential collisions are detected. These notifications help in taking immediate corrective actions to mitigate risks.
